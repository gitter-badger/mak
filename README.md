## URL / link
### File (#file)
> Files start with a hashtag `#` in the URL / link.  
> Files can be accessed via in-document links: `[my todos](#todo)`.  
> Files can be accessed via quick jumping: `go:todo` and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.  

+ Default notepad
  - [mak.ink#](https://mak.ink#): the default notepad
  - [mak.ink](https://mak.ink): or without the hashtag
+ Built-in notepads (**readonly**)
  - [mak.ink#readme](https://mak.ink#readme): documentation
  - [mak.ink#list](https://mak.ink#list): a place to find all your notepads
  - [mak.ink#preferences](https://mak.ink#preferences): preferences
  - [mak.ink#sample](https://mak.ink#sample): the sample document
+ Create your own notepad
  - [mak.ink#whatever_you_want](https://mak.ink#whatever_you_want)


### Mode (#file?mode)
> A mode is a pre-defined way to view files, so modes must be attached to a file.  
> Modes start with a question mark `?` in the URL / link.  
> Multiple modes are separated by `&`s: `mak.ink?dark&big`.  
> **Modes are defined by the URL, and won't be stored in settings.**  
> So if you click a link or open another file, current mode will be gone.  
> If you want to use a mode as default option, use settings below.  

+ View modes
  - [mak.ink#sample?edit](https://mak.ink#sample?edit): open sample in editor mode
  - [mak.ink#sample?read](https://mak.ink#sample?read): open sample in reading mode
  - [mak.ink?split](https://mak.ink?split): use split mode in the default notepad
+ Themes
  - [mak.ink?dark](https://mak.ink?dark): dark mode
  - [mak.ink?light](https://mak.ink?light): light mode (default)
+ Slides
  - [mak.ink?slide](https://mak.ink?slide): open in the slideshow mode
+ Other settings
  - [mak.ink?big](https://mak.ink?big): larger text
  - [mak.ink?cnt](https://mak.ink?cnt): show word counter (as tab title)
  - Bascially most of settings can be attached to files as modes.


### URL Action (?action)
> Actions are special modes.  
> Actions start with a question mark `?` in the URL / link,
  and use `=` to pass parameters.  
> Actions will be removed from URL automatically.  
> **Actions might do changes to your content.**  

+ Built-in actions
  - [mak.ink?gist=5d52fb081b3570c81e3a](https://mak.ink?gist=5d52fb081b3570c81e3a): load a gist
+ Combine with modes
  - [mak.ink?gist=5d52fb081b3570c81e3a&read](https://mak.ink?gist=5d52fb081b3570c81e3a&read): load a gist in reading mode


## Settings (`set:<option>`)
> You can type `set:<option>` and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> in the editor to change settings.  
> You can create a "set" link and click on it: `[dark](set:dark)`.  
> Settings change preferences globally and persistently.  
> **Settings can be override (locally) by current modes.**  

+ View mode settings
  - `set:split`
  - `set:edit`
  - `set:read`
+ Display settings
  - `set:dark`
  - `set:light`
  - `set:big`
+ Other

  - You can also use the _developer console_ to change settings :)


## More Details

### LaTeX
The LaTeX rendering feature is powered by [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).

You need to wrap the $ inside an inlined code block to render LaTeX inlined equations, or use $$ inside a multi-line code block to get an equation block:  

  `$\frac{\pi}{2}$`

or

  ```
  $$
  \frac{\pi}{2}
  $$
  ```


### gist
Use `?gist=<gist_id>` to load a GitHub gist. It will be stored to `#<gist_id>` automatically (and replace the original context, if exists).  

Note all the `<` and `>` will be replaced due to security reasons. By using `?gist=<gist_id>&xss` you can disable the replacing manually (but it could be dangerous).


### Embeding as iframe
[TBD.]


### Slideshow <sup>beta<sup>
A modified version of [remark](https://remarkjs.com/) is embeded to enable some slideshow features.

Slides are separated by `---`, checkout the **Examples** section below. And you can find more details in the remark documentation.

Also, this feature is beta currently and there could be unexpected errors.


### Drag and drop
You can drag your file into the editor, and its content will be **inserted** after your cursor automatically.  

Currently all files will be read as **plain text** files. And the file size limit is **10MB**.


### Desktop App
A menubar App as a sticker, no URL stuffs.

Early builds for macOS and Windows: [Mak mini](https://github.com/quietshu/makpad-mini).


### Mobile
Technique details: due to the slow progress of the [IME](https://caniuse.com/#feat=ime) API implementation on `contenteditable` elements, we're using the native `textarea` as the input handler on mobile devices to make IME work. But textareas cannot do any _styling_ or _customization_. So some implementations in CodeMirror (and any other in-browser editors) might be hacky which caused strange behaviours on mobile devices (such as cursor moving and copy-paste experience).  

Solution: make a native App.


### iOS App
[TBD.]

  - You can easily share a document / slide to others by using these URL schemas on gists.  


## Raw thoughts
[@chenglou](https://twitter.com/_chenglou) said this in ReactEurope:
> Not about potential power of doing more - it's about exploiting properties you gain by doing less. 

As I always believe: Text powers editors. Not the opposite.
